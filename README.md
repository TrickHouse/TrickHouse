Hello Everyone! My name is Trick and this is the start to my github account (obviously lol) 

I am new to actually learning about IT and more importantly Cyber Security but I am loving every second of it. 

The goal for this github is to post all of the projects that I develop in my journey of learning Python and the applicable uses of Python within Cyber Security. 

I am excited to offically start this journey with tangile resources like github and twitter where I am documenting my day to day journey into these topics. 
                                                                                   @Trick_House
Thanks in advance to any and all of the wonderful people who are bound to help me out :)
